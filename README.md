•	Real-Time Chat: Secure, real-time messaging between providers and clients.
•	Booking & Payment: Tools for scheduling, invoicing, and secure payment processing.
•	Rating & Reviews: System for collecting feedback after service delivery.
•	Admin Dashboard: Management console for monitoring platform activity, managing disputes, and analytics reporting.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
•	Service Providers: Freelancers and businesses with varying levels of technical expertise. They require an intuitive interface to showcase work and manage client communications.
•	Clients: Individuals or organizations seeking services. They require robust search capabilities, secure transaction processes, and clear communication channels.
•	Administrators: Internal team members who manage user accounts, content, and platform analytics.
2.4 Operating Environment

•	Third-party Integrations: Payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), messaging APIs, and location services.
2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
•	Must adhere to web security best practices.
•	Ensure compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
•	Use a scalable architecture to handle growing user bases.
•	Integrate seamlessly with third-party APIs for payments and messaging.
2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
•	Reliable internet connectivity for all users.
•	Third-party services (payment gateways, messaging platforms) will maintain consistent API availability.
•	Ongoing maintenance and support will be provided post-launch.
